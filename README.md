yii-globals
===========

Global shorthand functions for commonly used Yii methods.

## Setup

Before you can start using these shorthand functions in your code you need to include the globals.php file in your index.php.

```php
.....
require_once($yii);
require_once('path/to/globals.php');
Yii::createWebApplication($config)->run();
```
